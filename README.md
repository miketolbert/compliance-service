# Compliance Service - Expectations and Questions

## At a high level how would you build the compliance service to enable this level of runtime configuration?

Please see the following approaches:
1. [Simplified Approach (Monolith)](https://github.com/miketolbert/compliance-service/blob/main/SIMPLIFIED_APPROACH.md)
2. [Advanced Approach (Microservices)](https://github.com/miketolbert/compliance-service/blob/main/ADVANCED_APPROACH.md)


## What considerations would you make from a project management perspective?

Please see the sections titled "Project Management" for details in the 2 approaches.
- [Simplified Approach](https://github.com/miketolbert/compliance-service/blob/main/SIMPLIFIED_APPROACH.md#3-project-management)
- [Advanced Approach](https://github.com/miketolbert/compliance-service/blob/main/ADVANCED_APPROACH.md#3-project-management)


## How would you ensure success and timely delivery of this project?

**1. Choosing the Appropriate Approach:**
   - **Timeline Consideration:** Depending on the project timeline and resource availability, we will decide whether to start with a simplified monolithic approach or directly implement a more advanced microservices architecture.
   - **Phased Implementation:** Begin with the simplified approach to quickly deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and then progressively refactor into microservices as the project scales and additional complexity is required.

**2. Project Monitoring and Adjustments:**
   - **Regular Check-ins:** Conduct regular check-in meetings to assess progress, discuss roadblocks, and realign priorities.
   - **Agile Methodology:** Adopt Agile practices, such as Kanban, to ensure iterative development and continuous feedback.
   - **Task Tracking:** Use project management tools like Jira to track tasks, assign responsibilities, and monitor deadlines.

**3. Risk Management:**
   - **Identify Risks:** Proactively identify potential risks related to technical challenges, resource constraints, and timeline pressures.
   - **Mitigation Plans:** Develop mitigation plans for identified risks, including fallback strategies and contingency plans.

**4. Communication and Stakeholder Engagement:**
   - **Clear Communication:** Maintain clear and consistent communication with all stakeholders, ensuring everyone is informed about project status and any changes.
   - **Stakeholder Feedback:** Regularly gather feedback from stakeholders to ensure the project is meeting their expectations and adjust the project scope if necessary.

**5. Resource Allocation and Training:**
   - **Team Allocation:** Ensure the project team is adequately staffed with the necessary skill sets. Allocate resources effectively to balance workload and expertise.
   - **Training and Support:** Provide training and support for team members as needed, particularly when new technologies or methodologies are introduced.

**6. Quality Assurance and Testing:**
   - **Automated Testing:** Implement automated testing to quickly identify and resolve issues. Include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
   - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Set up CI/CD pipelines to streamline the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring rapid and reliable releases.

**7. Monitoring and Feedback Loops:**
   - **Observability:** Implement basic monitoring and logging from the start. Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch to ensure the system's health and performance.
   - **Feedback Loops:** Establish feedback loops from end-users to gather insights on usability and functionality, and make iterative improvements based on this feedback.

By following this structured approach, we can ensure the project stays on track, adapts to changing requirements, and ultimately delivers a successful compliance service in a timely manner.
